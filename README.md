# 🧩 eLTER-RI Controlled Vocabulary – Field Specification Vocabulary for the Data Reporting Format (DRF)

[![FAIR RDF Generation](https://github.com/LTER-Europe/elter_cl/actions/workflows/sheet2rdf.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/LTER-Europe/elter_cl/actions/workflows/sheet2rdf.yml)

The **DRF Field Specification Vocabulary** defines the controlled set of fields used in the **eLTER Data fields specification**.
It provides a harmonised and machine-actionable reference for describing the structure, meaning, and expected content of each field included in eLTER Data fields specification data products.

This vocabulary supports **semantic interoperability** across eLTER data workflows by ensuring that eLTER Data fields specification fields—such as identifiers, taxonomic information, temporal and spatial attributes, methodological descriptors, and measurement characteristics—are used consistently across sites, domains, and data providers
